# Contabo Command-Line Interface (CLI)

`cntb` is a command-line interface (CLI) for managing your products from Contabo like VPS and VDS.

## Installation

1. Download `cntb` as pre-built executable for your operating system (Windows, MacOS and Linux supported) on the [releases page](https://github.com/contabo/cntb/releases).
  * MacOS/Linux
    * curl -L '&lt;link to release&gt;' | tar xz
  * Windows
    * Right-click and select extract
2. You might move the executable to any location on your disk. You may update your `PATH` environment variable for easier invocation.

## Getting Started


1. Configure `cntb` once to use your credentials. You can obtain them from [Customer Control Panel](https://my.contabo.com/api/details).

  ```sh
  cntb config set-credentials --oauth2-clientid=<ClientId from Customer Control Panel> --oauth2-client-secret=<ClientSecret from Customer Control Panel> --oauth2-user=<API User from Customer Control Panel> --oauth2-password=<API Password from Customer Control Panel>
  ```

2. Use the CLI, e.g.

```sh
cntb help
```

## Examples

### List available images

```sh
cntb get images
```

### Upload custom image

```sh
cntb create image --name 'CentOS Cloud Image' --description 'CentOS 7 Cloud Image' --url 'https://cloud.centos.org/altarch/7/images/CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud.qcow2' --osType Linux --version 7
```

### Create / order new Compute Instance

Using Cloud-Init to set ssh public key

```sh
cntb create instance --imageId "ae423751-50fa-4bf6-9978-015673bf51c4" --productId "V92" --region "EU" --userData 'ssh_authorized_keys:
  - ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAGEA3FSyQwBI6Z+nCSjUUk8EEAnnkhXlukKoUPND/RRClWz2s5TCzIkd3Ou5+Cyz71X0XmazM3l5WgeErvtIwQMyT1KjNoMhoJMrJnWqQPOt5Q8zWd9qG7PBl9+eiH5qV7NZ'
# once finished please login via ssh
# in case of the previously uploaded CentOS 7 Cloud Image please use `centos` as user
# for standard images please use `admin` as user
```

Using Cloud-Init to install apache2 with an already stored SSH public key

```sh
cntb create instance --imageId "ae423751-50fa-4bf6-9978-015673bf51c4" --productId "V92" --region "EU" --sshKeys '1,2' --userData 'package_update: true
package_upgrade: true
packages:
  - httpd'
```

### Start Compute Instance

```sh
cntb start instance 12345
```

### Stop Compute Instance

```sh
cntb stop instance 12345
```

## Enable Shell Completion

```sh
cntb completion
Bash:

        $ source <(cntb completion bash)

        # To load completions for each session, execute once:
        # Linux:
        $ cntb completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/cntb
        # macOS:
        $ cntb completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/cntb

Zsh:

        # If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment,
        # you will need to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

        $ echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

        # To load completions for each session, execute once:
        $ cntb completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_cntb"

        # You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

fish:

        $ cntb completion fish | source

        # To load completions for each session, execute once:
        $ cntb completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/cntb.fish

PowerShell:

        PS> cntb completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

        # To load completions for every new session, run:
        PS> cntb completion powershell > cntb.ps1
        # and source this file from your PowerShell profile.
